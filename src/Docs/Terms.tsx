        Our Service is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. Ikuyo
        makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and
        negates all other warranties including without limitation, implied
        warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular
        purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation
        of rights.

        We do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, secure, or

        due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use
        the materials on Ikuyo's website or application, even if Ikuyo or an
        authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the
        possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow
        limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for
        consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to
        you.

        You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Ikuyo and its licensee

        losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not
        limited to attorney's fees).
      </p>

      <h2>Termination</h2>
      <p>
        We may terminate or suspend your account immediately, without prior
        notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without
        limitation if you breach the Terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon termination, your right to use the Service will cease immediately.
        If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue using
        the Service.
      </p>

      <h2>Severability</h2>
      <p>
        If any provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable or invalid,
        such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the
        objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under
        applicable law and the remaining provisions will continue in full force
        and effect.
      </p>

      <h2>Waiver</h2>
      <p>
        Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require
        performance of an obligation under these Terms shall not effect a
        party's ability to exercise such right or require such performance at
        any time thereafter nor shall the waiver of a breach constitute a waiver
        of any subsequent breach.
      </p>
